                    1) What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    1) There are three main ingredients that make up the world wide web.
                    URL (uniform resource locator), which is the addressing scheme to find a document;
                    HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), which connects computers together;
                    and HTML (hypertext markup language), which formats pages containing hypertext links.
                </p>

                <h1>
                    2) How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    2) The uniform resource locator (URL) is the most common form of resource identifier.
                    URLs describe the specific location of a resource on a particular server.
                    They tell you exactly how to fetch a resource from a precise, fixed location.
                </p>

                <h1>
                    3)  What are the general components of a url?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    3)There are 3 general components in a url.
                    The URL schema is used as an identifier in launching applications and performing a set of commands.
                    The scheme is the first part of a url, for example: https:// or http://
                    The server address is an external IP address that connects your computer to the Internet Service Provider (ISP),
                    enabling access to various domains worldwide.
                    The Page is the last part of a url.
                    The page directs the browser to a specific page on the website.
                </p>
