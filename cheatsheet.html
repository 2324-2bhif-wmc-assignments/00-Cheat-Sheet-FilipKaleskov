                    URL (uniform resource locator), which is the addressing scheme to find a document;
                    HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), which connects computers together;
                    and HTML (hypertext markup language), which formats pages containing hypertext links.

                <p>
                    2) The uniform resource locator (URL) is the most common form of resource identifier.
                    URLs describe the specific location of a resource on a particular server.
                    They tell you exactly how to fetch a resource from a precise, fixed location.

                    The URL schema is used as an identifier in launching applications and performing a set of commands.
                    The scheme is the first part of a url, for example: https:// or http://
                    The server address is an external IP address that connects your computer to the Internet Service Provider (ISP),
                    enabling access to various domains worldwide.
                    The Page is the last part of a url.
                    The page directs the browser to a specific page on the website.
