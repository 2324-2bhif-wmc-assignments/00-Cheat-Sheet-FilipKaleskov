                First of all every HTML Document starts with the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration which declares the version of an HTML document.
                <br>
                The &lt;html&gt; is the opening tag of the HTML document and marks the beginning and the end of the HTML content.
                <br>
                The &lt;html&gt; consists of the &lt;head&gt; element which contains metadata about the document, such as the document's title, character encoding, linked stylesheets, and scripts.
                The &lt;body&gt; element is also a part of the &lt;html&gt; element which is responsible for the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, and other elements that are displayed in the web browser.

                2) Identify void elements and how they are denoted
            </h1>
            <p>
                A void element is an element in HTML that doesn't have a closing tag.
                <br>
                It is marked up by a start tag only. Void elements are used to represent elements that have no content.
                <br>
                Some examples for void elements would be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    &lt;br&gt;
                </li>
                <li>
                    &lt;area&gt;
                </li>
                <li>
                    &lt;link&gt;
                </li>
                <li>
                    &lt;img&gt;
                </li>
            </ul>
